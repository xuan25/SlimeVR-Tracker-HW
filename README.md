## Please note: Before you send the case model to your 3D printer

**You may want to update the following parameters in the Case design Spreadsheet to match the performance of your 3D printer and material.**

- **Tol**: Adjusts the clearance between mating parts. Increase this value if your 3D printer cannot achieve tight tolerances, ensuring the parts fit together properly despite limited printing accuracy.
- **SnapFitNotchWidth**: Controls the depth of the snap-fit notch. A larger value can provide a more robust snap-fit connection but requires the material to have better toughness.
  - Plastics are usually stronger than resin, so you should consider to use a lower value.
- **BaseMargin**: Controls the margin of the base. Since the snap-fit will catch on the baseâ€™s margin, a smaller margin requires the material to have sufficient strength to ensure a reliable snap-fit connection.
  - Resin are usually softer than plastics, so you should consider to use a greater value.
